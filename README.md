Introduction:


The Iris dataset was a multivariate dataset introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his classic 1936 paper, “The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems” as an example of linear discriminant analysis and can be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris), (https://www.kaggle.com/jchen2186/machine-learning-with-iris-dataset/data). 
The data were originally collected and published by the statistically-minded botanist Edgar S. Anderson (https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/74776/what-aspects-of-the-iris-data-set-make-it-so-successful-as-an-example-teaching). 

Multivariate (Data analysis) refers to any statistical technique used to analyze data which arises from more than one variable (http://www.camo.com/multivariate_analysis.html).

Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a classification method originally developed by Fisher. It is simple, mathematically robust and typically produces models whose accuracy is as good as more complex methods. LDA is based upon the concept of searching for a linear combination of variables (predictors) that best separates two classes (http://chem-eng.utoronto.ca/~datamining/dmc/lda.htm). 
If you have more than two classes then LDA is the preferred linear classification technique. Conversely for example, logistic regression is a classification algorithm traditionally limited to only two-class classification problems (https://machinelearningmastery.com/linear-discriminant-analysis-for-machine-learning/).

Moreover, the dataset is often used for testing out machine learning algorithms, visualizations (e.g. scatterplots) (https://gist.github.com/curran/a08a1080b88344b0c8a7), and techniques such as  “support vector machines” i.e. supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. When data are not labelled, supervised learning is not possible, and an unsupervised learning approach is needed, which endeavours to find natural clustering of the data to groups, and then map new data to these formed groups. 
With the Iris dataset however, the use of cluster analysis is not typical, since the dataset only contains two clusters with obvious separation. One of the clusters contains Iris setosa, while the other cluster contains both Iris virginica and Iris versicolor and is not separable without the species information Fisher used (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).

Based on Fisher's linear discriminant model, this data set became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as testing out machine learning algorithms and visualisations. Machine learning (ML) is often, incorrectly, interchanged with artificial intelligence (AI), but machine learning is actually a sub field/type of AI. Machine learning is also often referred to as predictive analytics, or predictive modelling. Coined by American computer scientist Arthur Samuel in 1959, the term ‘machine learning’ is defined as a “computer’s ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”. 
At its most basic, machine learning uses programmed algorithms that receive and analyse input data to predict output values within an acceptable range. As new data is fed to these algorithms, they learn and optimise their operations to improve performance, developing ‘intelligence’ over time. (https://www.sas.com/en_ie/insights/articles/analytics/machine-learning-algorithms.html).

Indeed, the dataset is an excellent example of a traditional resource that has become a staple of the computing world, especially for testing purposes. New types of sorting models and taxonomy algorithms often use the Iris flower dataset as an input, to examine how various technologies sort and handle data sets. For example, programmers might download the Iris flower dataset for the purposes of testing a decision tree, or a piece of ML software. For this reason, the Iris dataset is built into some coding libraries, in order to make this process easier (e.g. Python’s "SkyLearn" module comes preloaded with it) (https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32880/iris-flower-data-set).

The Iris dataset is small but not trivial, simple but challenging, and the examples (cases) are real data, useful and of good quality.
